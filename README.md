# Performance Analysis of TCP Variants

## Description
This project analyzes the performance of various TCP variants using TCL scripts and Python utilities in NS2 simulations.

## Python Scripts

### `convert_trace_to_txt_files.py`
Converts NS2 trace files from `.tr` format to `.txt` for easier parsing.

### `index_tracefiles.py`
Reads trace files and converts them into CSV format with labeled columns, using Pandas.

## Folders

### General TCP Simulation
Contains TCL scripts and other resources for general TCP variant / TCP Tahoe simulations in NS2.

#### `tcp-ex1.tcl`
This TCL script initializes a basic NS2 simulation with two nodes connected by a duplex link. It sets up TCP agents, attaches an FTP application, and schedules its start and stop times. The trace of the simulation is saved in a file named `tcp-example2.tr`.

#### `python-analysis-tr.py`
This Python script takes the trace file generated by the TCL script and analyzes it to calculate various performance metrics. It computes the packet loss rate, throughput, and average end-to-end delay.

### TCP Reno and Vegas Simulation
Focused on simulations and analysis specific to TCP Reno and Vegas variants.

#### `reno.tcl`
This TCL script sets up a simulation environment for TCP Reno. It establishes a duplex link between two nodes, attaches a TCP Reno agent to one node and a sink to the other, and runs an FTP application over the link. The trace of this simulation is saved in a file named `reno.tr`.

#### `vegas.tcl`
Similar to `reno.tcl`, but this script sets up a simulation for TCP Vegas.

#### `python-analysis.py`
This Python script analyzes trace files for both Reno and Vegas simulations. It calculates metrics like packet loss rate, throughput, and average end-to-end delay for each.

### Time-Driven Simulation of UDP
Contains Python scripts to perform time-driven simulation using socket for UDP protocol.

### `labelled_trace_file.csv`
A CSV file that contains indexed and labeled NS2 trace data.
